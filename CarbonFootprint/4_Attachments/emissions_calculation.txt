CO2 emissions are calculated by considering the energy consumed during the loading of a web page.
This consumed energy is converted into carbon emissions, as electricity is often produced by burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil or natural gas,
which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
The process of calculating carbon emissions is based on the size of the web page, measured in bytes, and the energy consumed to load it, measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
By knowing the amount of energy consumed, we can estimate the carbon emissions produced during the loading of the page.
All this is analysed to provide an estimate of the CO2 emissions associated with viewing a web page, helping to understand the environmental impact of surfing the Internet.
